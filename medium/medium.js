// Write a function that will allow you to calculate how many slices of pizza x 
// each person y would get if they shared evenly. The function should return 
// an interpolated string like Each person gets 4.00 slices of pizza; from our 
// 8-slice pizza x being a decimal in case there is no way to split the pizza evenly.

// SOLUTION TO PROBLEM

function pizzaCalc(slices, people) {
    let slicesAmt = slices;
    
    let peopleAmt = people;

    let pizzaAmt = (slices / people);

    let total = pizzaAmt.toFixed(2);

    console.log(`Since there are ${peopleAmt} people and ${slicesAmt} slices of pizza, every person gets ${total} slices of pizza. Enjoy!`);
}

pizzaCalc(8, 4); // Since there are 4 people and 8 slices of pizza, every person gets 2 slices of pizza. Enjoy!

pizzaCalc (10, 6); // Since there are 6 people and 10 slices of pizza, every person gets 1.67 slices of pizza. Enjoy!
